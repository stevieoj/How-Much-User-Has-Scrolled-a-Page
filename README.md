## How many times a user scrolled a page
This module computes the number of times a user scrolled through a web page.
Detecting how much the user has scrolled forms the basis for many interesting effects, 
such as parallax or opt-in boxes that only pop up when you've reached the bottom of the
page. We now have the essential parts to implement these effects ourselves.
